<h1>About me</h1>

<p>I'm a software engineer who has worked in the industry in various capacities for the last decade. I got my start writing PHP for an education startup. From there, I have worked for digital agencies, banks, and in satellite applications.</p>

<p>I hold a first-class Masters of Engineering (MEng) degree in Software Engineering from Aberystwyth University, which I attained in 2017.</p>

<p>I'm a keen cyclist and collector or retro & vintage video games - my pride and joy is a ZX Spectrum +2A 007 Edition that I found in the store room of a charity shop I was volunteering at as a teenager.</p>
