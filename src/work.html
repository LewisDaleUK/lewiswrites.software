<section class="stack">
    <h2>Technology I work with</h2>
    <p>
        I consider myself a generalist, which means I don't limit myself to a single tech stack, but I usually like to work with:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>HTML/CSS</li>
        <li>Javascript</li>
        <li>Typescript</li>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>PHP</li>
        <li>C#/.NET</li>
    </ul>
